# Crowdfunding Data Processing

This repository contains code for processing crowdfunding data, including campaigns and contact information. The code performs various data cleaning and transformation tasks using pandas and numpy libraries in Python.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of two Excel files:

1. `crowdfunding.xlsx`: Contains information about crowdfunding campaigns.
2. `contacts.xlsx`: Contains contact information related to the campaigns.

## Data Processing Steps

1. **Crowdfunding Data**

   - Read the `crowdfunding.xlsx` file into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Split the "category & sub-category" column into separate "category" and "subcategory" columns.
   - Create new category and subcategory columns with unique IDs.
   - Export the category and subcategory data as CSV files.
   - Rename columns and convert data types as required.
   - Clean the data and merge with the category and subcategory information.
   - Drop unnecessary columns.
   - Export the cleaned campaign data as a CSV file.

2. **Contact Information**

   - Read the `contacts.xlsx` file into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Iterate through the DataFrame and convert each row to a dictionary.
   - Create a new DataFrame with the contact information.
   - Split the "name" column into separate "first_name" and "last_name" columns.
   - Reorder the columns.
   - Export the cleaned contact information as a CSV file.

## Files

- `crowdfunding_info_df.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for processing crowdfunding data.
- `Resources/`: Directory containing the input Excel files and the exported CSV files.
    - `crowdfunding.xlsx`: Input file with crowdfunding campaign information.
    - `contacts.xlsx`: Input file with contact information.
    - `category.csv`: Exported category information.
    - `subcategory.csv`: Exported subcategory information.
    - `campaign.csv`: Exported cleaned campaign data.
    - `contacts.csv`: Exported cleaned contact information.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies: pandas and numpy.
2. Place the input Excel files (`crowdfunding.xlsx` and `contacts.xlsx`) in the `Resources/` directory.
3. Run the code in the `crowdfunding_info_df.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to process the data.
4. The processed data will be exported as CSV files in the `Resources/` directory.
